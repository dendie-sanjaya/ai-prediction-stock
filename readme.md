This project shows how to use a special type of AI called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict stock prices. The project is split into two main parts: **Training the AI Model** and **Making Predictions (Inference)**.

## System Overview

This system design follows a common approach in Machine Learning for data that changes over time (like stock prices). We train the AI once, and then use it many times to make new predictions.

Here are the main parts and how they work together, shown in a simple diagram:


## Component Details

### 1\. Training Phase

This part of the project is about teaching the LSTM model to understand patterns from past stock prices.

  * **`training-data_saham_multivariable.csv` (Historical Stock Data)**

      * **What it is:** A big collection of past stock price data. We use this data to "teach" our AI model how stock prices usually move.
      * **Format:** A CSV file that contains different types of information for each day (like `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Volume`, and `Close` prices). Having more types of data helps the model learn better.

  * **`training.py` (Train AI Model)**

      * **What it is:** This is the Python code that handles all the steps for training our AI model.
      * **Main Tasks:**
          * **Load Data:** Reads the historical stock data from `training-data_saham_multivariable.csv`.
          * **Prepare Data:** It "normalizes" the data (changes values to a 0-1 scale) using `MinMaxScaler`. This makes it easier and faster for the AI model to learn.
          * **Create Time Sequences:** Arranges the data into "sequences" or "windows" (e.g., looking at the past 60 days). This is how LSTM models like to receive data.
          * **Build Model:** Sets up the structure of the LSTM AI network.
          * **Train Model:** Teaches the LSTM model using the prepared data.
          * **Save Model & Scaler:** After training, the trained AI model (`model_saham_lstm.h5`) and the data scaler (`scaler_saham.pkl`) are saved. This means we don't have to train them again every time we want to make a prediction.

### 2\. Prediction Phase

This part uses the trained AI model from the first phase to make new predictions about future stock prices, using the most recent historical data.

  * **`model_saham_lstm.h5` (Trained AI Model)**

      * **What it is:** This file is the result of `training.py`. It holds the trained AI model's structure and all the patterns it learned. This model is ready to make predictions.

  * **`scaler_saham.pkl` (Part of Trained AI Model)**

      * **What it is:** This file saves the exact `MinMaxScaler` that was used during training. It's super important for:
          * **Preparing New Data:** Any new historical data must be "normalized" using this same scaler so the model understands it correctly.
          * **Converting Predictions Back:** It helps convert the AI's predictions (which are in the 0-1 scale) back to real stock prices (like actual dollar values).

  * **`history-data_saham_multivariable.csv` (Latest Stock History Data)**

      * **What it is:** A CSV file containing the very latest historical stock price information.
      * **How it's used:** The `prediction.py` script will take the last few days of data (matching `N_TIMESTEPS`, e.g., the last 60 days) from this file. This acts as the "starting point" for the AI to predict future prices, one day at a time.
      * **Important:** The columns in this file must be exactly the same as in `training-data_saham_multivariable.csv`.

  * **`prediction.py` (Predict Stock Prices)**

      * **What it is:** A separate Python script specifically for making predictions.
      * **Main Tasks:**
          * **Load AI Tools:** Loads the saved `model_saham_lstm.h5` and `scaler_saham.pkl`.
          * **Load New History:** Reads the very latest stock history from `history-data_saham_multivariable.csv`.
          * **Prepare Prediction Input:** Uses the loaded `scaler` to normalize the latest history and creates the correct sequence (e.g., 60 days) for the model's input.
          * **Recursive Prediction:** Uses the loaded AI model to predict stock prices for a number of days ahead (e.g., 5 days). Each new prediction is then added back to the sequence to help predict the next day.

  * **`prediksi_harga_masa_depan.png` (5-day Stock Price Forecast)**

      * **What it is:** A picture generated by the `prediction.py` script. It's a graph that shows the actual past stock prices and the AI's predicted prices for the next few days.

## Conclusion

This design is a strong and effective way to build a stock price prediction system using LSTM. By clearly separating the training and prediction parts, the project is organized, easy to expand, and ready to be used in real-world situations.
